# Introduction to Elixir for Rubyists

Elixir is a concurrency-oriented programming language built atop the Erlang VM.
Its syntax is very Ruby-influenced, and it takes some great features from the
Python world as well.

In this talk, I'll provide a quick introduction to the language.  I'll provide
just a quick overview of the language syntactically, as well as cover some areas
where it differs wildly from Ruby.

I'm Josh Adams, CTO of [Isotope Eleven](http://isotope11.com) and purveyor of
[ElixirSips](http://www.elixirsips.com).  I've built large-scale Ruby systems
since 2005, and began learning Erlang in the middle of 2013.  I moved from
Erlang to Elixir after a few months, and have been screencasting my journey
learning the language ever since.
